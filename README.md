# Toolkit-for-HBC-sensing
This repository supplyies the basic concept of human body capacitance sening and the related hardware design, the collected data from experiments that combines HBC sensing and IMU sensing for human activity recognition, and the used machine learning algorithms for induvisual and collaborative activity classification. More details are stated in our manuscript "Human Body Capacitance: a Novel Wearable Motion Sensing Approach Besides IMU and its Contribution to Human Activity Recognition".
